# SEATTLE VS VANCOUVER RAIN

> We will use the data science methodology to investigate whether it rains more in Seattle, WA than in Vancouver, BC (where I used to live). The problem is simple; As I have lived in Vancouver for more than seven years, I think that it rains too much in Vancouver. However, my in-laws have lived in Seattle for more than a decade, and they debate it rains more in Seattle.  I want to use data to determine whether it rains more in Seattle, WA than in Vancouver, BC.

## Project Overview

We will use daily precipitation measured in Seattle and Vancouver from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2022. The data sets were downloaded from the National Centers for Environmental Information NOAA tool : Search | Climate Data Online (CDO) | National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). 

- **Objective:** The goal of the project is to find which city has more rain.
- **Domain:** Environment
- **Key Techniques:** Descriptive Approach

## Analysis

The file that has been used seattle_vancouver_weather_.ipynb to analyze data. The format for the date values was changed to standardize, and the precipitation was visualized to see how precipitation varies over time. Both the datasets were merged to compare the precipitation. The mean precipitation for each city, monthly precipitation by city, proportion of days with precipitation each month and number of rainy days with more than 2mm of precipitation was analyzed to find which city incurs more rain.

## Results

The results have been depicted as Vancouver and Seattle have similar average precipitation levels, Vancouver tends to experience more intense rainfall and a greater number of days with significant precipitation, especially in the wetter seasons. Seattle, on the other hand, has more frequent but lighter rainy days.
