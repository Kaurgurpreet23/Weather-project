## Analysis

The file that has been used seattle_vancouver_weather_.ipynb to analyze data. The format for the date values was changed to standardize, and the precipitation was visualized to see how precipitation varies over time. Both the datasets were merged to compare the precipitation. The mean precipitation for each city, monthly precipitation by city, proportion of days with precipitation each month and number of rainy days with more than 2mm of precipitation was analyzed to find which city incurs more rain.

## Results

The results have been depicted as Vancouver and Seattle have similar average precipitation levels, Vancouver tends to experience more intense rainfall and a greater number of days with significant precipitation, especially in the wetter seasons. Seattle, on the other hand, has more frequent but lighter rainy days.
